BREAKING: Drop support for node < 10 BREAKING: Rename $true-terminal-output setting to $terminal-output Support testing content properties which include a curly brace. Update dev dependencies 5.0.0 (06/03/19) BREAKING: Update API for runSass, which now accepts two arguments: a sassOptions object and a trueOptions object. BREAKING: Drop support for node < 8 Add docs and testing for usage with Jest #135 Add sass option to runSass for passing a different Sass implementation than node-sass #137 Remove node-sass from peerDependencies Fix deprecated use of assert.fail #138 Update dev dependencies 4.0.0 (04/09/18) BREAKING: Move node-sass to peerDependencies Update dependencies Add JS coverage reporting 3.1.0 (03/06/18) NEW: Add contains() mixin for more minute output comparisons. Works the same as expect(), but doesn’t require a complete match. Update docs 3.0.2 (10/6/17) Dependency updates 3.0.1 (9/13/17) Update docs 3.0.0 (8/26/17) Update dependencies & release 3.0.0-beta.1 (6/1/17) Added describe and it mixins, as alias for test-module and test respectively. Added $inspect argument to assert-equal and assert-unequal mixins, for comparing inspect($assert) == inspect($expected) instead of $assert == $expected. This helps with several of the equality edge-cases listed below (rounding and units). BREAKING: No more Ruby gem or Ruby CLI BREAKING: No more bower package BREAKING: Removes special-handling of equality, in favor of allowing Sass to determine the best comparisons. There are a few edge-cases to be aware of: In some versions of Sass, manipulated numbers and colors are compared without rounding, so 1/3 != 0.333333 and lighten(#246, 15%) != #356a9f. Use the $inspect argument to compare rounded output values. In all versions of Sass, unitless numbers are considered comparable to all units, so 1 == 1x where x represents any unit. Use the $inspect argument to compare output values with units. Lists compare both values and delimiter, so (one two three) != (one, two, three). This can be particularly confusing for single-item lists, which still have a delimiter assigned, even though it is not used. 2.2.2 (4/11/17) assert-true returns false on empty strings and lists assert-false returns true on empty strings and lists Module/Test/Assertion stats are included in reports 2.2.1 (2/7/17) Output CSS context around Mocha parsing errors. Added $fail-on-error argument to report() mixin. Set to true if you need the Sass compiler to fail on broken tests. Fix bug with assert-false causing it to fail on null values. Allow unquoted descriptions and test/module names. Fix bug throwing off test-count and reporting. 2.1.4 (12/22/16) Fix default assertion messages Upgrade dependencies 2.0.2 (5/13/15) Fixes debug inspector. 2.0.1 (5/9/15) Improve internal logic, and namespace private functions behind _true-*. Add assert(), input, and expect mixins for testing CSS output. Support for LibSass. Add Mocha JS integration. — Create NPM package. Simplify output options down to single $true-terminal-output setting. Add eyeglass support. 1.0.1 (10/18/14) LibSass 3.0 compatability. 1.0.0 (10/3/14) Add command-line interface: true-cli <path-to-file> Use -s flag for silent output Check for unit differences between numbers. Add assertion-failure details to css output. 0.2.0 (7/15/14) Simplified reporting in both terminal and CSS. Remove default-module-output, $default-test-output and $default-final-output. Replace them with $true settings map: (output: css, summary: terminal css). output handles test/module output, summary handles final output. Assertions are always output to the terminal if they fail. Update to use Sass map variables. Add report function and report mixin, for reporting final results. Only register as a compass extension if compass is present. Compass is no longer an explicit dependency. Adjust the output styles to work with Sass 3.4 and have more visual consistency. 0.1.5 (6/10/13) Append actual results to custom failure messages. 0.1.4 (6/9/13) Null result is considered a failure. Allow output to be turned off for certain modules/tests/assertions. 0.1.3 (6/7/13) Nest assertions within test() {} named tests. Cleaner css output. 0.1.2 (6/7/13) Use nesting for modules with test-module() {} Added failure message argument to all assertions. 0.1.1 (6/6/13) Fix bug in lib/true.rb compass plugin registration. 0.1.0 (6/6/13) assert-true(), assert-false(), assert-equal(), and assert-unequal(). pass() and fail() for tracking and reporting individual results. start-test-module() and report-test-result() for module results.

All of the test code is written in pure Sass, and can be compiled by the Dart Sass compiler – but we also provide integration with JavaScript test runners (e.g. Mocha or Jest), for extra features and improved reporting. Verb To make true; shape, adjust, place, etc., exactly or accurately: True the wheels of a bicycle after striking a pothole. To make even, symmetrical, level, etc. (often followed by up): True up the sides of a door. To test your Sass code; debug, perfect, etc. (often using True): True your sweet plugin before you deploy. Install In command line: npm install sass-true Import in your test directory, like any other Sass file: @use 'true' as *; Depending on your setup, you may need to include the full path name: // This is only an example @use '../node_modules/sass-true/sass/true' as *; One Setting $terminal-output (boolean), defaults to true true will show detailed information in the terminal for debugging failed assertions or reporting final results. This is the default, and best for compiling without a JavaScript test runner. false will turn off all terminal output from Sass, though Mocha/Jest will continue to use the terminal for reporting. Usage True is based on common JS-testing patterns, allowing both a test-module/test syntax, and the newer describe/it for defining the structure: @include test-module('Zip [function]') { @include test('Zips multiple lists into a single multi-dimensional list') { // Assert the expected results @include assert-equal(zip(a b c, 1 2 3), (a 1, b 2, c 3)); } } This is the same as… @include describe('Zip [function]') { @include it('Zips multiple lists into a single multi-dimensional list') { // Assert the expected results @include assert-equal(zip(a b c, 1 2 3), (a 1, b 2, c 3)); } } Sass is able to compare values internally, meaning function-output and variable values can easily be compared and reported during Sass compilation. CSS output tests, on the other hand, have to be compared after compilation is complete. You can do that by hand if you want (git diff is helpful for noticing changes), or you can use our Mocha or Jest integration. Output tests fit the same structure, but assertions take a slightly different form, with an outer assert mixin, and a matching pair of output and expect to contain the output-values. // Test CSS output from mixins @include it('Outputs a font size and line height based on keyword') { @include assert { @include output { @include font-size('large'); } @include expect { font-size: 2rem; line-height: 3rem; } } } You can optionally show a summary report in CSS and/or the command line, after the tests have completed: @include report; See the full documentation online or in the .sassdoc directory, for more details. See CHANGELOG.md when upgrading from an older version of True. Using Mocha, Jest, or other JS test runners Install true via npm: npm install --save-dev sass-true [Optional] Install sass (Dart Sass), if not already installed. npm install --save-dev sass Write some Sass tests in test/test.scss (see above). Write a shim JS test file in test/test_sass.js: var path = require('path'); var sassTrue = require('sass-true'); var sassFile = path.join(__dirname, 'test.scss'); sassTrue.runSass({ file: sassFile }, { describe, it }); Run Mocha/Jest, and see your Sass tests reported in the command line. You can call runSass more than once, if you have multiple Sass test files you want to run separately. The first argument to runSass accepts the same options that sass’ renderSync function accepts. The only modification runSass makes is to add True’s sass path to the includePaths option, so @use 'true'; works in your Sass test file. The second argument is an object with required describe and it options, and an optional contextLines option. Any JS test runner with equivalents to Mocha’s or Jest’s describe and it should be usable in the same way: just pass your test runner’s describe and it equivalents in the second argument to runSass. If True can’t parse the CSS output, it’ll give you some context lines of CSS as part of the error message. This context will likely be helpful in understanding the parse failure. By default it provides up to 10 lines of context; if you need more, you can provide a numeric contextLines option: the maximum number of context lines to provide. Imports without Webpack If you use Webpack’s tilde notation, like @use 'accoutrement/sass/tools', you’ll need to tell runSass how to handle that. That will require writing a custom importer and passing it into the configuration for runSass. Something like: function importer(url, prev, done) { if (url[0] === '~') { url = path.resolve('node_modules', url.substr(1)); } return { file: url }; } sassTrue.runSass({ importer, file: sassFile }, { describe, it });"},"LICENSE.html":{"filename":"LICENSE.html","title":"BSD3 License","contents":"Copyright © 2015, Miriam Eric Suzanne All rights reserved.
