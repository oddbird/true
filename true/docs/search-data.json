CSS Output","contents":"Testing CSS Output Unlike value assertions (which are evaluated during Sass compilation), CSS output assertions generate compiled CSS that must be compared to verify correctness. The assert(), output(), and expect() mixins work together to create this testable output. Important: CSS output tests require comparison after Sass compilation. You have two options for verifying output: Manual comparison – Use git diff or similar tools to review changes in the compiled CSS output. True generates structured CSS comments containing the test results, which you can inspect manually. JavaScript test runner – Integrate with Mocha, Jest, Vitest, or similar test runners to automate the comparison. The JS integration parses the CSS output and reports differences automatically. See: https://www.oddbird.net/true/docs/#javascript-test-runner-integration @mixin assert() Define a CSS-output assertion. Assertions are used inside the test() mixin to define the expected results of the test. The assert() mixin is a wrapper, and should contain one output() block and one expect() block as nested contents. These three mixins together describe a single assert-equal comparison on output CSS.

When using Mocha/Jest integration, the output comparison is automated – otherwise you will have to compare the output manually. Using git diff is a great way to watch for changes in output. Parameters $description: null (string) Description of the assertion being tested. A null of false value generates a default description. @content (code block) Use `output()` and `expect()` mixins to define blocks for comparison Example scss @include true.test('Sass math compiles before output') { @include true.assert('You can also describe the assertion...') { @include true.output { width: 14em + 2; } @include true.expect { width: 16em; } } } css compiled /* Test: Sass math compiles before output */ /* ASSERT: You can also describe the assertion... */ /* OUTPUT */ .test-output { width: 16em; } /* END_OUTPUT */ /* EXPECTED */ .test-output { width: 16em; } /* END_EXPECTED */ /* END_ASSERT */ /* */ Requires $output (bool) [private] @mixin output() Describe the test content to be evaluated against the paired expect() block. Assertions are used inside the test() mixin to define the expected results of the test. The output() mixin requires a content block, and should be nested inside the assert() mixin along with a single expect() block. These three mixins together describe a single assert-equal comparison on output CSS. The compiled CSS-results of the output() mixin will be compared against the results of the expect() mixin. When using Mocha/Jest integration, the output comparison is automated – otherwise you will have to compare the output manually. Using git diff is a great way to watch for changes in output. Parameters $selector: true (bool) Optionally wrap the contents in a .test-output selector block, so you can test property-value output directly. @content (code block) Define the test content to be checked Example scss @include true.test('Sass math compiles before output') { @include true.assert { @include true.output { width: 14em + 2; } @include true.expect { width: 16em; } } } css compiled /* Test: Sass math compiles before output */ /* ASSERT: */ /* OUTPUT */ .test-output { width: 16em; } /* END_OUTPUT */ /* EXPECTED */ .test-output { width: 16em; } /* END_EXPECTED */ /* END_ASSERT */ /* */ @mixin expect() Describe the expected results of the paired output() block.

Parameters $selector: true (bool) Optionally wrap the contents in a .test-output selector block, so you can test property-value output directly. @content (code block) Define the expected results of a sibling `output()` mixin Example scss @include true.test('Sass math compiles before output') { @include true.assert { @include true.output { width: 14em + 2; } @include true.expect { width: 16em; } } } css compiled /* Test: Sass math compiles before output */ /* ASSERT: */ /* OUTPUT */ .test-output { width: 16em; } /* END_OUTPUT */ /* EXPECTED */ .test-output { width: 16em; } /* END_EXPECTED */ /* END_ASSERT */ /* */ @mixin contains() Describe the expected results of the paired output() block. The contains() mixin requires a content block, and should be nested inside the assert() mixin, along with a single output() block. Assertions are used inside the test() mixin to define the expected results of the test. These three mixins together describe a single comparison on output CSS. The compiled CSS-results of the contains() mixin will be compared against the results of the output() mixin to see if all of the contains CSS is within the output CSS. When using Mocha/Jest integration, the output comparison is automated – otherwise you will have to compare the output manually. Using git diff is a great way to watch for changes in output. Parameters $selector: true (bool) Optionally wrap the contents in a .test-output selector block, so you can test property-value output directly. @content (code block) Define the expected results of a sibling `output()` mixin Example scss @include true.test('Sass math compiles before output') { @include true.assert { @include true.output { height: 100%; width: 14em + 2; } @include true.contains { width: 16em; } } } css compiled /* Test: Sass math compiles before output */ /* ASSERT: */ /* OUTPUT */ .test-output { height: 100%; width: 16em; } /* END_OUTPUT */ /* CONTAINED */ .test-output { width: 16em; } /* END_CONTAINED */ /* END_ASSERT */ /* */ @mixin contains-string() Describe a case-sensitive substring expected to be found within the paired output() block. The contains-string() mixin requires a string argument, and should be nested inside the assert() mixin along with a single output() block. Assertions are used inside the test() mixin to define the expected results of the test. These mixins together describe a comparison on output CSS, checking if the compiled CSS-results of the output() mixin contain the specified $string-to-find. When using Mocha/Jest integration, the output comparison is automated – otherwise you will have to compare the output manually. Using git diff is a great way to watch for changes in output.

In some cases, you may still need one of the following: Numeric tests with long decimals should use math.round() to explicitly compare values at the desired level of precision, rather than relying on the unreliable precision of the meta.inspect() function. Tests that rely on map output might throw an error since ‘maps’ are not a defined CSS syntax.

Added $inspect argument to assert-equal and assert-unequal mixins, for comparing inspect($assert) == inspect($expected) instead of $assert == $expected. This helps with several of the equality edge-cases listed below (rounding and units). BREAKING: No more Ruby gem or Ruby CLI BREAKING: No more bower package BREAKING: Removes special-handling of equality, in favor of allowing Sass to determine the best comparisons. There are a few edge-cases to be aware of: In some versions of Sass, manipulated numbers and colors are compared without rounding, so 1/3 != 0.333333 and lighten(#246, 15%) != #356a9f. Use the $inspect argument to compare rounded output values. In all versions of Sass, unitless numbers are considered comparable to all units, so 1 == 1x where x represents any unit. Use the $inspect argument to compare output values with units. Lists compare both values and delimiter, so (one two three) != (one, two, three). This can be particularly confusing for single-item lists, which still have a delimiter assigned, even though it is not used. 2.2.2 (4/11/17) assert-true returns false on empty strings and lists assert-false returns true on empty strings and lists Module/Test/Assertion stats are included in reports 2.2.1 (2/7/17) Output CSS context around Mocha parsing errors.

Create JS test file Create a JavaScript shim to run your Sass tests (e.g., test/sass.test.js): import path from 'node:path'; import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'; import sassTrue from 'sass-true'; const __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)); const sassFile = path.join(__dirname, 'test.scss'); sassTrue.runSass({ describe, it }, sassFile); 4. Run your tests Run Mocha, Jest, Vitest, or your test runner. Sass tests will appear in the terminal output. Enable Watch Mode for Sass Files By default, vitest --watch and jest --watch don’t detect Sass file changes. Vitest solution: Add Sass files to forceRerunTriggers: // vitest.config.js module.exports = defineConfig({ test: { forceRerunTriggers: ['**/*.scss'], }, }); See Vitest documentation for details. Jest solution: Add \"scss\" to moduleFileExtensions: // jest.config.js module.exports = { moduleFileExtensions: ['js', 'json', 'scss'], }; See Jest documentation for details. Advanced Configuration runSass() API sassTrue.runSass(testRunnerConfig, sassPathOrSource, sassOptions); Arguments: testRunnerConfig (object, required) Option Type Required Description describe function Yes Your test runner’s describe function it function Yes Your test runner’s it function sass string or object No Sass implementation name ('sass' or 'sass-embedded') or instance. Auto-detected if not provided. sourceType 'string' or 'path' No Set to 'string' to compile inline Sass source instead of file path (default: 'path') contextLines number No Number of CSS context lines to show in parse errors (default: 10) sassPathOrSource ('string' or 'path', required) File path to Sass test file, or Inline Sass source code (if sourceType: 'string') sassOptions (object, optional) Standard Sass compile options (importers, loadPaths, style, etc.) Default modifications by True: loadPaths: True’s sass directory is automatically added (allowing @use 'true';) importers: Node.js package importer added if importers is not defined and Dart Sass ≥ v1.71 (allowing @use 'pkg:sass-true' as *;) ⚠️ Warning: Must use style: 'expanded' (default). style: 'compressed' is not supported. Multiple Test Files Call runSass() multiple times to run separate test files: sassTrue.runSass({ describe, it }, path.join(__dirname, 'functions.test.scss')); sassTrue.runSass({ describe, it }, path.join(__dirname, 'mixins.test.scss')); Other Test Runners Any test runner with describe/it functions (or equivalents) works with True: // Example with custom test runner import { suite, test } from 'my-test-runner'; sassTrue.runSass( { describe: suite, it: test }, path.join(__dirname, 'test.scss'), ); Custom Importers If you use custom import syntax (e.g., tilde notation @use '~accoutrement/sass/tools'), you’ll need to provide a custom importer: import path from 'node:path'; import { fileURLToPath, pathToFileURL } from 'node:url'; import sassTrue from 'sass-true'; const __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)); const importers = [ { findFileUrl(url) { if (!url.startsWith('~')) { return null; } return new URL( pathToFileURL(path.resolve('node_modules', url.substring(1))), ); }, }, ]; const sassFile = path.join(__dirname, 'test.scss'); sassTrue.runSass({ describe, it }, sassFile, { importers }); Sponsor OddBird’s Open Source Work At OddBird, we love contributing to the languages and tools developers rely on.
