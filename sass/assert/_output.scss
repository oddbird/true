// Assert [output]
// ---------------
/// Define a CSS-output assertion.
/// Assertions are used inside the `test()` mixin
/// to define the expected results of the test.
/// - The `assert()` mixin is a wrapper,
///   and should contain one `output()` block and one `expect()` block
///   as nested contents.
/// - These three mixins together describe a single
///   `assert-equal` comparison on output CSS.
///   The compiled CSS-results of the `output()` mixin
///   will be compared against the results of the `expect()` mixin.
/// - When using Mocha/Jest integration, the output comparison is automated –
///   otherwise you will have to compare the output manually.
///   Using `git diff` is a great way to watch for changes in output.
///
